"""Aspects of Facial Recognition:
  1) Facial Detection
  2) Data Gathering (extracting unique characteristics that can be used to differentiate one person from another)
  3) Data Comparison (comparing of unique features, despite variations in light, angle, ect.)
  4) Face Recognition
  Source: https://www.superdatascience.com/opencv-face-recognition/
  
  Aspects of OpenCV Face Recognition:
  1) Data Gathering: Gather face data (face images in this case) of the persons you want to identify.
  2) Train the Recognizer: Feed that face data and respective names of each face to the recognizer so that it can learn.
  3) Recognition: Feed new faces of that people and see if the face recognizer you just trained recognizes them.
  
  Using: EigenFaces â€“ cv2.face.createEigenFaceRecognizer()
  Why? 
    - algorithm understands that not all parts of the face are equally important or useful in facial recognition 
    - distinct features are most important (eyes, nose, cheeks, forehead) that have areas of MAXIMUM change 
    - looks at images of people as a whole and tries to extract the components which are relevant, while discarding the rest
    
 Background Notes:
  - A computer program that decides whether an image is a positive image (face image) or negative image (non-face image) is a classifier.
  - OpenCV provides two classifiers: Haar Classifier (machine learning approach, windows are placed on each picture to calculate a single feature)
    and LBP Classifier
